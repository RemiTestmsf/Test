    <h2>Key Safety Practices</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>All live cables must be inaccessible. Refer to <b>Rules & Tools</b> p. 111.</li>
        <li>The neutral and canopy of all generators must be grounded. Refer to <b>Rules & Tools</b> p. 81 and 191.</li>
        <li>All sockets must be grounded. Refer to <b>Rules & Tools</b> p. 159.</li>
        <li>There is 300-mA Residual Current Device (RCD) protection on all general circuits. Refer to <b>Rules & Tools</b> p. 93.</li>
        <li>There is 30-mA Residual Current Device (RCD) on all final circuits. Refer to <b>Rules & Tools</b> p. 93.</li>
        <li>Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB) and electrical wires are properly scaled. Refer to <b>Rules & Tools</b> p.149.</li>
        <li>There is an ABC type fire extinguisher of dry powder close to every distribution board and generator. They are updated in the maintenance plan.</li>
        <li>Sensitive equipment must be protected against voltage and frequency variations. Refer to the <b>Equipment Protection Table</b>.</li>
        <li>Critical zones/wards (e.g. OT and ICU) are equipped with back-up systems (UPS). Refer to <b>UPS installation requirements</b>.</li>
        <li>The power assessment and consumption measurements are made regularly.</li>
        <li>Generators and UPS systems are scaled based on the power requirements assessment. Refer to <b>Power assessment tools</b>.</li>
        <li>Facilities are visited by an electrician every 6 to 18 months.</li>
        <li>A power requirement assessment is carried out every 6 months.</li>
        <li>Proper grounding must be installed to prevent electrocution risks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <ul>
            <li>Splicing connections without electrical connectors.</li>
            <li>Not installing proper grounding.</li>
            <li>Leaving live wires unprotected.</li>
            <li>Using non-waterproof fittings outdoors.</li>
            <li>Not having a maintenance plan.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>The logistics team is responsible for ensuring safe electrical installations. If they lack expertise, a certified electrician should be hired.</p>
