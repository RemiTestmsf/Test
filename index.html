        <h1>BASICS: ENERGY</h1>

        <h2>BASIC 1</h2>
        <p>Individuals are protected against electrocution and fire. Devices are protected against fire, power stability, and effects of lightning.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All live cables must be inaccessible. Refer to Rules & Tools p. 111.</li>
            <li>The neutral and canopy of all generators must be grounded. Refer to Rules & Tools p. 81 and 191.</li>
            <li>All sockets must be grounded. Refer to Rules & Tools p. 159.</li>
            <li>There is 300-mA Residual Current Device (RCD) protection on all general circuits. Refer to Rules & Tools p. 93.</li>
            <li>There is 30-mA Residual Current Device (RCD) on all final circuits. Refer to Rules & Tools p. 93.</li>
            <li>Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCB) and electrical wires are properly scaled. Refer to Rules & Tools p.149.</li>
            <li>There is an ABC type fire extinguisher of dry powder close to every distribution board and generator. They are updated in the maintenance plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>BASIC 2</h2>
        <p>Services are protected against breakdown, failure of power sources, or effects of any other interruption.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sensitive equipment must be protected against voltage and frequency variations. Refer to the Equipment Protection Table.</li>
            <li>Critical zones/wards (e.g., OT and ICU) are equipped with backup systems (UPS). Refer to UPS installation requirements.</li>
            <li>The power assessment and consumption measurements are made regularly.</li>
            <li>Generators and UPS systems are scaled based on the power requirements assessment. Refer to Power assessment tools.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Facilities are visited by an MSF electrician 6 months after opening and every 18 months thereafter.</li>
            <li>A power requirement assessment is carried out every 6 months.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users and facilities are safe from electrocution due to direct contact, insulation faults, or bad grounding.</li>
            <li>Fires do not break out due to overloads or short circuits.</li>
            <li>Ensures the continuity of medical and non-medical activities.</li>
            <li>No damaged equipment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <ul>
                <li>Connections are spliced (connection without electrical connectors).</li>
                <li>There is no junction box.</li>
                <li>Grounding is not installed.</li>
                <li>Live wires are left without mechanical protection (trunking, pipe, etc.).</li>
                <li>The generator is grounded but the neutral is not bonded.</li>
                <li>RCD protection is 300 mA instead of 30 mA for sensitive circuits.</li>
                <li>Non-waterproof fittings (junction boxes, plugs, light fixtures, etc.) are installed outdoors.</li>
                <li>The person doing electrical work is not an electrician trained in MSF standards.</li>
                <li>No maintenance plan in place.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Log is responsible for the assessment of the installation and for deciding if electrical work is needed.</li>
            <li>If the Log is not qualified enough to carry out the electrical work, an electrician must be contacted.</li>
            <li>The Log must ensure that proper assessments are carried out on time by qualified electricians.</li>
            <li>The Log is responsible for ensuring energy service continuity and proper backup.</li>
            <li>If the Log is not experienced enough to ensure service continuity, an electrician must be contacted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Necessary Resources</h2>

        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>After assessment (~1 week), technical design (~1 week), and procurement (from 1 week to 3 months), it can take around 10 to 25 days to bring a 100mÂ² facility up to standard.</p>

        <h3>Supply</h3>
        <p>Local suppliers must be validated according to the local purchasing procedure. If quality cannot be ensured, international purchase is preferred. Watch out for counterfeit items!</p>

        <h3>HR (Human Resources)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Level 9, Energy Manager: Design, implementation, and coordination of complex and/or large energy projects.</li>
            <li>Level 8, Energy Specialist: Ensures the correct management and control of electrical installations.</li>
            <li>Level 5, Electrician: Performs preventive and corrective maintenance of electrical equipment and installation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>Essential items include: RCD, RCD tester, wire gauge, voltmeter, junction boxes, rapid connectors, terminal blocks, circuit breakers, grounding rods, electrician tool bags, and UPS systems.</p>
